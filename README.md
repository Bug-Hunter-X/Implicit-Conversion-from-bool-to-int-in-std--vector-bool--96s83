# Implicit Conversion from bool to int in std::vector<bool>
This example demonstrates a potential issue with implicit type conversion when using `std::vector<bool>`.  While `std::vector<bool>` is specialized for memory efficiency, accessing elements as integers might lead to unexpected behavior due to implicit boolean-to-integer conversion.

## Problem
The `std::vector<bool>` specialization in C++ optimizes storage by packing boolean values. However, this optimization affects how elements are accessed.  Directly accessing an element as an integer (`int`) can cause an implicit conversion that might not produce the desired result in all situations.  For example, the result of the implicit conversion will always be 0 or 1, which is likely not problematic; however, in some cases, it is useful to use explicit conversion.

## Solution
To prevent any unexpected behavior, it is recommended to explicitly cast the boolean value to an integer using static_cast<int>(vec[0]) when an integer representation is needed.  This approach ensures that the conversion is clearly indicated and leaves no room for ambiguity.
